eventSignIn
===========

A quick website I built to simplify the process of signing into events on campus. Designed such that an event can belong to a club, and the event can be open/closed. In addition, there is/will be a portal to view more information about the event and edit it.

The site is based off a project by IBM's Joe Lennon and is talked about here: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-nodejs-polling-app/

Since starting this project I have re-written the back end and made significant changes to the front end.

Instructions:
============
1. Install nodejs from http://nodejs.org/
2. Install mongodb from https://www.mongodb.org/
3. Pull eventSignIn
4. ```npm install```
5. Change to the eventSignIn Directory and: ```node app.js```
6. Open another terminal and navigate to mongodb\bin\
7. Run mongod
